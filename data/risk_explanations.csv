Bias,LOW,Plagiarism_Detection,"Basic database matching has minimal bias risks but may miss some forms of academic dishonesty. False positives are rare with this approach since it only flags exact matches from known sources.",,
Bias,MEDIUM,Plagiarism_Detection,"AI-generated content detection shows higher false positive rates for non-native English speakers and certain writing styles. These tools may incorrectly flag legitimate student work as AI-generated based on linguistic patterns rather than actual cheating.",,
Bias,HIGH,Plagiarism_Detection,"Writing style analysis can discriminate against students with different linguistic backgrounds or learning disabilities. These systems may flag diverse writing patterns as suspicious rather than recognizing legitimate stylistic differences.",,
Bias,CRITICAL,Plagiarism_Detection,"AI writing detectors have been found to be unreliable increasing the potential for false positives. When implemented at the systemic level, these tools might unfairly flag or single out academic work created by specific groups of students.",,

Bias,HIGH,LLM_Tutors,"Conversational AI with personalized responses can amplify existing biases through tailored interactions. These systems may make assumptions about student capabilities or learning styles based on limited interaction data.",,
Bias,CRITICAL,LLM_Tutors,"Anthropomorphic AI tutors may exhibit cultural biases in personality design and emotional responses. These systems can reinforce stereotypes about authority, communication styles, and appropriate learning behaviors.",,
Privacy,LOW,LLM_Tutors,"Independent session design with no data persistence protects student privacy completely. Each interaction remains isolated with no accumulation of personal learning information over time.",,
Privacy,MEDIUM,LLM_Tutors,"Basic usage analytics capture interaction frequency and duration without storing conversation content. This creates minimal privacy exposure while still enabling some system improvement and monitoring.",,
Privacy,HIGH,LLM_Tutors,"Detailed conversation logging captures intimate student learning moments and academic struggles. This data collection can expose sensitive information about learning disabilities, personal challenges, or academic insecurities.",,
Privacy,CRITICAL,LLM_Tutors,"Comprehensive behavioral profiling creates detailed psychological and academic profiles of individual students. This intensive data collection transforms learning interactions into surveillance opportunities that can follow students throughout their academic careers.",,
Flourishing,LOW,LLM_Tutors,"Supplemental AI tutoring preserves human relationships as the primary source of educational guidance. Students maintain agency in choosing when and how to engage with AI support while keeping human mentorship central.",,
Flourishing,MEDIUM,LLM_Tutors,"Targeted AI tutoring assignment may create dependency among certain student groups. This approach can inadvertently signal that some students need artificial assistance while others can succeed with human guidance alone.",,
Flourishing,HIGH,LLM_Tutors,"Widespread AI tutor integration can reduce authentic peer learning and collaborative problem-solving opportunities. Students may become accustomed to individual AI guidance rather than developing social learning skills.",,
Flourishing,CRITICAL,LLM_Tutors,"Anthropomorphic AI tutors can create artificial emotional bonds that replace authentic human mentorship relationships. Students may become overly dependent on AI guidance rather than developing critical thinking and peer collaboration skills.",,
Organizational,LOW,Plagiarism_Detection,"Optional plagiarism detection tools require minimal organizational change and preserve existing academic integrity processes. Faculty maintain full autonomy in deciding when and how to use these technological supports.",,
Organizational,MEDIUM,Plagiarism_Detection,"Systematic plagiarism detection requires new institutional policies and faculty training programs. This creates moderate administrative burden while potentially improving consistency in academic integrity enforcement.",,
Organizational,HIGH,Plagiarism_Detection,"Institution-wide plagiarism screening demands significant policy development, staff training, and appeals process creation. The administrative overhead may divert resources from core educational activities.",,
Organizational,CRITICAL,Plagiarism_Detection,"Comprehensive automated plagiarism systems fundamentally restructure academic integrity processes and may deskill faculty in evidence evaluation. The institution becomes dependent on external technology vendors for core educational functions.",,
Organizational,LOW,LLM_Tutors,"Voluntary supplemental AI tutoring requires minimal institutional infrastructure changes. Existing support systems remain primary with AI providing optional additional assistance.",,
Organizational,MEDIUM,LLM_Tutors,"Targeted AI tutor deployment requires staff training and integration planning. This creates moderate organizational change while maintaining human-centered support as the foundation.",,
Organizational,HIGH,LLM_Tutors,"Systematic AI tutor integration demands extensive teacher training and oversight protocols. The administrative burden of monitoring AI interactions may reduce time available for direct student support.",,
Organizational,CRITICAL,LLM_Tutors,"AI tutors as primary instructional delivery fundamentally restructure teaching roles and may lead to faculty reduction. The institution risks losing essential human expertise and relationship-building capacity.",,
Accuracy,LOW,Plagiarism_Detection,"Database matching provides reliable detection for exact plagiarism but may miss paraphrased or sophisticated academic dishonesty. The accuracy is high for direct copying but limited in scope.",,
Accuracy,MEDIUM,Plagiarism_Detection,"AI-generated content detection has moderate accuracy but produces false positives and negatives. The technology is still developing and may incorrectly identify human writing as AI-generated or vice versa.",,
Accuracy,HIGH,Plagiarism_Detection,"Advanced plagiarism detection may provide detailed analysis but can produce misleading results when analyzing legitimate student work. The complexity of these systems can make accuracy assessment difficult for educators.",,
