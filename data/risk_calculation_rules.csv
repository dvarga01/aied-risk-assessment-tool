COMP_01,Compound Risk,BIOMETRIC_ESC AND Vulnerable_Population,Escalate to CRITICAL,BA AND PS,Biometric monitoring of vulnerable populations escalates bias and privacy risks,IF Question contains BIOMETRIC_ESC AND Context shows vulnerable population THEN escalate BA and PS to CRITICAL
COMP_02,Compound Risk,SURVEILLANCE_SCOPE AND MONITOR_RETENTION,Escalate to CRITICAL,PS AND MC AND OH,Comprehensive surveillance with long retention creates critical institutional harm,IF SURVEILLANCE_SCOPE (D answer) AND MONITOR_RETENTION (C or D answer) THEN escalate all to CRITICAL
COMP_03,Compound Risk,SUBJ_GRADING AND BIAS_TEST_CRIT,Escalate to CRITICAL,BA AND MA,AI grading subjective work without bias testing is critical risk,IF GRAD_Q1 (C or D answer) AND PROC_Q3 (C or D answer) THEN escalate BA and MA to CRITICAL
COMP_04,Compound Risk,TEACHER_REPLACE AND Vulnerable_Population,Maintain CRITICAL,OH AND HI AND BA,AI teacher replacement in vulnerable communities is critical harm,IF ADAP_Q2 (D answer) AND vulnerable population THEN maintain CRITICAL for OH HI BA
COMP_05,Compound Risk,CONTENT_BIAS AND CULTURAL_BIAS,Add +1 Severity,BA AND HI,Multiple sources of cultural bias compound harm,IF CONT_Q3 (C or D) AND TUT_Q1 (C or D) THEN add +1 severity to BA and HI
COMP_06,Bootstrap Risk,Multiple_Tools_With_Same_Risk,Add +1 Severity per additional tool,ALL,Repeated exposure to same harm type across multiple tools compounds over time,Count tools with same risk category - add +1 severity for each additional tool beyond first
COMP_07,Bootstrap Risk,TRANSPARENCY AND DEPENDENCY,Add +2 Severity,HI AND MA,Opaque systems that create dependency have multiplicative compounding effects,IF (TUT_Q3 C or D) AND (TUT_Q4 C or D) THEN add +2 to HI and MA
COMP_08,Critical Escalation,PREDICTIVE_HARM AND BEHAVIOR_PROF AND Vulnerable_Population,Force CRITICAL,ALL,Comprehensive behavioral prediction of vulnerable students affects all categories,IF SAFE_Q2 (C or D) AND PROC_Q2 (C or D) AND vulnerable population THEN force ALL to CRITICAL
COMP_09,Critical Escalation,APPEAL_RIGHTS AND High_Stakes,Force CRITICAL,HI AND BA AND OH,Opaque high-stakes decisions without appeals concentrate harmful power,IF GRAD_Q3 (C or D) AND (GRAD_Q1 C or D OR SAFE_Q1 C or D) THEN force CRITICAL for HI BA OH
COMP_10,Critical Escalation,AI_TRANSPARENCY AND Multiple_Hidden_Uses,Add +2 Severity,HI AND BA AND MA,Hidden AI use across multiple educational functions undermines authentic learning,IF CONT_Q4 (C or D) AND count of other non-disclosed AI uses THEN add +2 to HI BA MA
MOD_01,Context Modifier,Elementary_Students AND Privacy_Risk,Add +2 Severity,PS,Young children have heightened privacy vulnerability,IF CONT_Q1 = A AND any PS risk THEN add +2 to PS severity
MOD_02,Context Modifier,Elementary_Students AND Bias_Risk,Add +2 Severity,BA,Young children are more susceptible to bias formation and reinforcement,IF CONT_Q1 = A AND any BA risk THEN add +2 to BA severity
MOD_03,Context Modifier,Vulnerable_Population AND Any_Critical_Risk,Maintain CRITICAL,ALL,Vulnerable populations should not have critical risks reduced below critical,IF CONT_Q2 (C or D) AND any CRITICAL risk THEN prevent reduction below CRITICAL
MOD_04,Context Modifier,High_AI_Readiness AND Non_Critical_Risk,Subtract -1 Severity,ALL,Strong institutional preparation can mitigate some risks,IF CONT_Q3 = A AND risk below CRITICAL THEN subtract -1 from severity
MOD_05,Context Modifier,Teacher_Autonomy_High AND Educational_Harms,Subtract -1 Severity,OH AND HI,High teacher control reduces educational AI harms,IF CONT_Q4 = A AND (OH OR HI risks) THEN subtract -1 from severity
FLOOR_01,Severity Floor,Any_Critical_Risk AND Vulnerable_Population,Cannot go below CRITICAL,ALL,Critical risks to vulnerable populations cannot be mitigated below critical,IF any CRITICAL risk AND CONT_Q2 (C or D) THEN floor at CRITICAL
FLOOR_02,Severity Floor,Comprehensive_Surveillance,Cannot go below HIGH,PS AND MC AND BA,Comprehensive surveillance maintains high minimum risk regardless of mitigation,IF SAFE_Q1 = D THEN floor PS MC BA at HIGH minimum
FLOOR_03,Severity Floor,Subjective_AI_Grading,Cannot go below MEDIUM,BA AND MA,AI grading subjective work maintains medium minimum risk,IF GRAD_Q1 (C or D) THEN floor BA MA at MEDIUM minimum
FLOOR_04,Severity Floor,Biometric_Monitoring,Cannot go below MEDIUM,PS AND BA,Any biometric data collection maintains medium minimum privacy and bias risk,IF PROC_Q1 (B C or D) THEN floor PS BA at MEDIUM minimum
